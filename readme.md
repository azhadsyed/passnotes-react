# Heroku Hello World

Dave Ceddia wrote a Heroku deployment tutorial using create-react-app and express: https://daveceddia.com/deploy-react-express-app-heroku/

This is my attempt to follow the tutorial before deploying [Amara's](https://github.com/amara-j) and my similar app, [Passnotes](https://github.com/azhadsyed/passnotes-react).
